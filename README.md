Carbon - Minimal FPS Game Server 
--------------------------------

**Carbon** is JavaScript based, minimal client / server framework for creating 
fast paced multiplayer action games.

It archives this goal by using the following techniques:

- Low frequency tick based state updates
- Client-Side Prediction 
- Server Reconciliation
- Entity Interpolation
- Server Side State Rewind for Hit Detection

## API / Usage

Right now **Carbon** is really just a bare-metal framework. 

I'm currently working on a 2D top-down shooter game for up to 8 players which 
will serve as the demo application for the library.
